### JS Engine

- JS engine has three major things
    a. Parsing
    b. Compilation
    c. Execution

### parsing
- parsing has few steps
    a. code gets broken down into tokens
      - `let a = 10` => this will be broken into tokens where `let`, `a`, `=`, `10` will all be tokens
    b. then `AST` which is a syntax parser, will generate the tree from those tokens
